# Modified-8Puzzle-AI
Modified version of 8-Puzzle game in Python.
 Reaching the solution was done using Artificial Intelligence and different search algorithms (Depth First, Breadth First, Iterative Deepening, Uniform Cost, Greedy Best First, and A-Star with three different heuristics).
 In this version, the cost of a move is not 1, but the VALUE OF THE TILE BEING MOVED
